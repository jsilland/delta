In the past two years, there has been an *enormous* amount of time and energy spent developing and implementing open web specifications – platform features
The obvious goal is to bring the web platform to parity with native platforms, with the intent of blurring the lines
Chrome will soon run Android apps, and web apps are becoming richer – there's a path to convergence. I'm convinced Google will eventually make Javascript a first class language on Android.
This effort is especially sponsored by Google, as part of the Blink rendering engine, but also by Mozilla and Microsoft. Apple's lagging behind – they don't care much.

Web Components & Polymer
  - lets you create valid, custom HTML elements, e.g. <strava-activity>, <strava-record-button>
  - Each element maps to an instance of a JavaScript class, i.e. <strava-record-button> <-> StravaRecordButton
  - Attributes maps to object properties, i.e <strava-segment id="12345"> -> StravaSegment.id = 12345
  - Lifecycle callbacks: created, ready, attached, detached:
     StravaAthlete.ready: ->
       @athlete = fetchAthlete(@id)
  - Data binding and templating:
     // in strava-athlete.html
     <template>
       <strava-avatar url="{{athlete.avatar}}">
     </template>
     // in strava-avatar.html
     <style> img { border-radius: 50%; }</style>
     <template>
       <img src="{{url}}">
     </template>

Ready-made elements to display UI widgets (e.g. Google Maps) but also to perform tasks such as AJAX queries.

Geo Location API
  - Ever been annoyed by those websites asking for your location?
  - This API is mostly useless on desktop
  - It shines on mobile, especially for Strava's needs

  @watchId = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(
        (position) => @updatePosition(position),
        (error) => @positionUpdateError(error),
        {enableHighAccuracy: true, timeout: 5000, maximumAge: 0}
    )

Bluetooth API
  - Unfortunately didn't get to it to work with an HRM

Wake Lock API

Screen orientation API
  screen.orientation.lock('portrait-primary')

Image Selection API
  - As simple as
  <input type="file" accept="image/*" multiple>
  - The host browser is responsible for handling the event

Speech Synthesis API

  - Literraly speaks for itself
speechSynthesis.speak(new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Segment Rocket Mile 6 minutes 43 seconds'))

Application Manifest API
  - Lets your web app be installed on the launch screen
  - Declared as JSON

{
  "name": "Strava Record",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/assets/images/manifest/launcher-icon-4x.png",
      "sizes": "224x224",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "start_url": "/record",
  "display": "standalone",
  "orientation": "portrait"
}

  - published in the document's head
<head>
<link rel='manifest' href='/assets/manifest.json'>
</head>

Service workers
  - Makes web application work offline
  - Lets you bundle an application as a set of resources
    - Javascript, HTML, assets of any kind
  - Creates a proxy between an application and the network
  - Provides robust caching of resources

Chrome inspecting and remote debugging tools
  - Simply spectacular
  - Connect an Android phone, enable debugging, go to chrome://inspect
  - Implements port forwarding
  - Supports proxying (for external libraries)
  - Inspect remote webviews on your desktop machine – the same way you normally would
